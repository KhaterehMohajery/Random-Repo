This is the first entry  I am putting in my blog.  I am so excited to start a path to become a data scientist. For a while I was doubtful of what I want to do with my life. But now that I started learning more about data, its usage and implications and the statistical and programming tools to be able to efficiently handle and work with data, I think I finally found something that I really like to do and enjoy. 
Stay tuned to my next post where I will share some of cool stuff I learnt during few weeks of doing GA data immersive program.
